    import math
    # Assign values to x and n
    x = 4
    n = 3
    
    # Method 1
    power = x ** n
    print("%d to the power %d is %d" % (x, n, power))
    
    # Method 2
    power = pow(x, n)
    print("%d to the power %d is %d" % (x, n, power))
    
    # Method 3
    power = math.pow(2, 6.5)
    print("%d to the power %d is %5.2f" % (x, n, power))
